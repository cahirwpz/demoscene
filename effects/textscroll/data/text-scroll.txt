                             CAHIR ON THE KEYBOARD

I'M STILL SURPRISED THAT THIS DEMO WORKS AT ALL. ONLY A WEEK BEFORE THE PARTY
I MANAGED TO FIX ALL REMAINING BUGS IN THE SMALL OPERATING SYSTEM THAT RUNS 
THIS TRACKMO. THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT THREADS. BOTH RUN CONCURRENTLY SO THE NEW
EFFECT IS BEING LOADED INTO MEMORY, DECOMPRESSED AND RELOCATED, WHILE THE MAIN 
THREAD RENDERS THE PREVIOUS EFFECT.

WE HAVEN'T MADE FULL USE OF THIS "TECHNOLOGY" - SO EXPECT MORE TO FOLLOW ;)
SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENTS WERE MADE IN MY 3D RENDERING CODE, AGAIN WITH SOME
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. THANKS TO CARRION WE STARTED USING COLORFUL 2-BITPLANE
IMAGES THAT MADE OUR BACKGROUNDS WAY MORE INTERESTING.

            ALL IN ALL OUR INITIAL EXPECTATIONS WERE GREATLY EXCEEDED.
                   WE ARE TRULY PROUD OF THIS TRACKMO. ENJOY!

                AS ALWAYS, I SEND LOTS OF HUGS & KISSES TO ALICE,
       FOR HER SUPPORT THROUGHOUT WHOLE DEMO-MAKING PROCESS. THANK YOU <3


                      JAZZCAT & SLAYER ON THE KEYBOARD

       WE'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR NEW MEMBERS: POLPROG, ZUKO,  AND SLIZGI!
                            YOU ARE ALL AWESOME!! 

             AND REMEMBER - THE EARTH IS FLAT, BECAUSE YOU ARE FAT!
