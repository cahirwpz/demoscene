                              CAHIR ON THE KEYS:

  "Sunglasses at Night" was almost entirely written in hand optimized C with
very few assembly inlines - "9/10 of the time is spent in 1/10 of the code" :P

                                <advertisment>
                  The demo is open sourced and available at:

          https://github.com/cahirwpz/demoscene/tree/sunglasses/a500

Now... go there, download it, learn how to use it and make some cool demo for
  next demoscene party! Another thing worth to mention: I maintain GCC cross
 compiler targeting classic Amiga. Sources and build script are available at:

              https://github.com/cahirwpz/m68k-amigaos-toolchain

  If you think you're into compilers and linkers, please drop me a message.

 Thanks go to Photon/Scoopex for updated P61 routine, sp/ctz for fast blitter
         c2p idea and Keir Fraser for extremely fast deflate routine.

   Personal greetings fly to: Argasek, Fei, Kiero, Dakota, Hakon, Voyager,
  Epyon, Hilander, people at II UWr and friends from Google (hey, Han Shen!)

After 1,5 yrs of "demoscene rehab" we decided to make another stuff. We did it
very quickly. inspired by swimming in the Adriatic sea, 3 bottles of Bushmills 
                           and some newwave music.

           Personal greetz fly to Sosabowski and all graphic friends: 
Codi, Cosh, Darklight, Jok, Farfar, Veto, Prowler, Sim1, Substrate and Piesiu.
