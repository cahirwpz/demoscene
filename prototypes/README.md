Prototypes
===

Java based effect prototypes have been tested on Processing 3.5.4.

Please note that on MacOSX files listed below must be updated for Processing to
work correctly:

```
gluegen-rt-natives-macosx-universal.jar
gluegen-rt.jar
jogl-all-natives-macosx-universal.jar
jogl-all.jar
```

The files reside under `Contents/Java/core/library` directory of
`Processing.app`. Please download [jogl v2.4.0-rc-20200307](
https://jogamp.org/deployment/archive/rc/v2.4.0-rc-20200307/archive/jogamp-all-platforms.7z),
unpack it and replace Processing counterparts accordingly.
